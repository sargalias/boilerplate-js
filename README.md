# Sample front end JavaScript project configuration

## Configuration

- Webpack
- Babel
- Sourcemaps
- Minification
- Scss
- Development server
- Dist directory refresh plugin
- Auto-generated index.html file
- Code-splitting
- Suitable production options (separate from development options)
  - CSS extraction into a separate file
  - Sourcemaps

## Modify the configuration

It's recommended that you go through the configuration in this boilerplate and modify it with what you need for your own project.

For each option, it's recommended that you check the relevant documentation and then make your changes.

For example, ESLint will probably need modification to something that's suitable for you and your project.
